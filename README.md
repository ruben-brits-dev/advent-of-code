# 🎄 My Advent of Code Repository

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This is where I will document my journey through the annual coding challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I am only starting in 2024 and will add my solutions, written in the programming language of my choice, showcasing problem-solving skills and creative approaches.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year, with each year's solutions stored in its own directory:
(This might change depending on the programming language used at the time)

```
advent-of-code/
├── 2023/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── day02/
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── day01/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- Each **year's folder** contains subfolders for each day of the challenge.
- Inside each **day's folder**, you'll find:
  - My solution for the puzzle.
  - `README.md`: (Hopefully) A brief explanation of the solution I came up with and the thought process behind it.
